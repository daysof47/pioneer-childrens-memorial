    <p>Thousands of pioneer children walked, rode and camped their way through more than 1,300-miles of trail from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the Land of Zion in Utah. It was an adventure for most. They played and argued like most children. They picked berries, slept out under the stars, and danced. Some suffered, but most made it to Utah no worse for the wear. Tragically, however, 684 of them died during the trek.</p>

    <p>The Days of '47, Inc. and This Is The Place State Park, with the help of generous donors, have created a striking, new memorial to the 684 children who lost their lives while making their way to Zion on the pioneer trail in the mid-1800’s.</p>

    <p>The new memorial is located at This Is The Place State Park in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the names of the children are etched in stone so they will not be forgotten. Their stories are told through a variety of innovative, time-honored, artistic ways that bring them and the trail to life. Come and see for yourself. The stories are tender, you’ll feel the connections and your heart will be touched.</p>
