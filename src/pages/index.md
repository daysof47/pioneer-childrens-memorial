    <p>Thousands of pioneer children walked, rode and camped their way through more
    than 1,300-miles of trail from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the Land of Zion in
    Utah. It was an adventure for most. They played and argued like most
    children. They picked berries, slept out under the stars, and danced. Most
    made it to Utah no worse for the wear. Tragically, however, 684 of them died
    on the trail.</p>

    <p><em>The Days of '47, Inc.</em> and <em>This Is The Place Heritage Park</em>, with the help
    of generous donors, have created a striking, new Pioneer Children's Memorial
    to honor the 684 children who lost their lives while making their way to
    Zion on the pioneer trail in the mid-1800’s.</p>

    <p>The new memorial is located at <em>This Is The Place Heritage Park</em> in Salt
    Lake City, Utah, where the names of the children are etched in stone so they
    will never be forgotten. Their stories are told through a variety of
    innovative, time-honored, artistic expressions that bring them and the trail
    to life. Come and see for yourself. The stories are tender, you’ll feel
    connections and your heart will be touched.</p>

  description: "Artistic creativity brings the children’s stories to life in more than 47 bronze statues at the new <em>Pioneer Children's Memorial</em>. Each statue represents multiple stories in a unique way. On the surface, the larger-than-life bronze sculptures portray the trail history, but on a deeper level they symbolize the grit, resilience and what handcart pioneer Jens Nielsen called (stickity-to-ity)\r stick-to-itiveness, – the qualities they used to make the western desert “blossom as a rose.” Artist sculpted the statues in conjunction with the Metal Arts Foundry in Lehi, Utah."
