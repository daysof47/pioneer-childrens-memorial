    <p>More than 20 life-sized bronze statues tell and symbolize the children’s
    stories throughout the Pioneer Children’s Memorial. Renowned sculptors
    Robert and Stephanie Hunt, and Stan Watts worked for more than two years
    with dozens of support people to create the stunning statues that bring the
    children’s pioneer trek to life. </p>

      <p>Artists and sculptors Roger and Stefanie Hunt were involved with the
      Pioneer Children’s Memorial from its inception, and created many of the
      statues in the memorial.</p>


      <p>Roger’s love for art and sculpting began under the tutelage of his
      art-teacher father, and from his job in a bronze casting foundry while in
      high school. At the foundry, he worked with and learned from
      nationally-known artists, who became his mentors and friends — all of
      which led to his full-time sculpting job.</p>


      <p>Stafanie’s love for the craft began when she met her future husband
      Roger while a student at Brigham Young University. That relationship led
      to employment at Wasatch Bronze in Lehi, Utah, where she developed her
      passion for sculpture. She has 30 years of sculpting experience.</p>


      <p>Roger said, “We feel privileged to be part of the Pioneer Children’s
      Memorial. It is humbling to bring our skills and hearts to bear on such
      touching and sacred historical events which are so meaningful to us
      all.”</p>

      <p>Sculpting bronze statues is a complex process. The statues are sculpted
      in clay on a metal frame first, and if life-sized, have to be formed in
      pieces. A wax mold is made of each piece, then painted with ten ceramic
      coatings that create an outer shell. It takes ten days for each coat to
      cure. Once cured, the wax is melted away, and the shell is dipped in
      bronze. The pieces are welded together and any damage caused by the
      process is fixed. The artist then details the statue to perfection.</p>


      <p>“Each statue is unique and has its own individual touch,” said Hunt.
      “That is the attraction of bronzes.”</p>

      <p>Utah native, Stan Watts, is a nationally-renowned bronze statue
      sculptor known for his work portraying the history of The Church of Jesus
      Christ of Latter-day Saints and of the United States.</p>


      <p>Early in his career, he was tutored by sculptor Dr. Arvard Fairbanks.
      Some of his notable work includes the bronze statue in front of the
      Nauvoo, Illinois Temple depicting Joseph Smith, Jr. and Hyrum Smith on
      horseback riding to Carthage Jail, and the George Washington bronze at the
      Freedom Foundation in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. He was commissioned with
      the Hunts to create bronze statues at the Pioneer Children’s Memorial.</p>
