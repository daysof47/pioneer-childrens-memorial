  description: <p>Historians have documented more than 600 children who died along
    the trail, but we know there are more. Our plea is for you to check your
    family history and add the names of children, or <a
    href="/#tell-a-story">submit</a> stories that we missed to this website, so
    they can be honored, too. The documented names are listed below.</p>
  heading: A Plea for Your Help

  We're always looking to add names and stories to the memorial. If you have
  information about a pioneer child that passed in the trek to Utah, we'd love
  to hear about it. Click the link below to submit a name and share your story.
